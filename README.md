This application provides all the details of the requested movie such as overview, genre, release date, rating, runtime, top cast, reviews, recommended movies, etc.

The details of the movies(title, genre, runtime, rating, poster, etc) are fetched using an API by TMDB, https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api, and using the IMDB id of the movie in the API, I did web scraping to get the reviews given by the user in the IMDB site using `beautifulsoup4` and performed sentiment analysis on those reviews.

## How to get the API key?

Create an account in https://www.themoviedb.org/, click on the `API` link from the left hand sidebar in your account settings and fill all the details to apply for API key. If you are asked for the website URL, just give "NA" if you don't have one. You will see the API key in your `API` sidebar once your request is approved.

## How to run the project?

1. Clone this repository in your local system.
2. Install all the libraries mentioned in the requirements.txt file with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. If urllib3 is not installed, install it with the command `pip install urllib3`.
4. Replace YOUR_API_KEY in **both** the places (line no. 23 and 43) of `static/recommend.js` file.
5. Open your terminal/command prompt from your project directory and run the `main.py` file by executing the command `python main.py`.
6. Go to your browser and type `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in the address bar.
7. Hurray! That's it.
